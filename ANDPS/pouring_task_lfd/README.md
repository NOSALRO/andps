# Physical Robo Experiment Pouring Task (Experiment 4)
With this experiment we showcase that ANDPs:
- Work with realistic demonstrations,
- and can learn a task that requires precision and end-effector orientation control

No evaluation script is provided since the trained policy was directly tested into the real robot.
